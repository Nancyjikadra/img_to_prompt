# Reverse-Engineered Stable Diffusion: Image-Based Prompt Generation  

This repository showcases a project where **stable diffusion** techniques are reverse-engineered to generate image-based prompts. By integrating advanced deep learning models such as **ViT**, **CLIP**, and **BLIP**, the project demonstrates a robust framework for leveraging these models collaboratively. The work also explores **loss computation** techniques to refine the generated outputs.  

## Features  
- **Reverse Engineering Stable Diffusion**: Explores the mechanics of stable diffusion and attempts to reverse it for generating image prompts.  
- **Model Integration**: Combines Vision Transformer (ViT), CLIP, and BLIP for feature extraction and semantic analysis.  
- **Loss Computation**: Implements loss functions to optimize the reverse-generation process.  
- **Advanced Tech Stack**: Developed using Python and PyTorch for seamless integration with deep learning models.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Framework**: PyTorch  
- **Models**:  
  - **BLIP**: Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining for image-caption tasks.  
  - **ViT**: Vision Transformer for image recognition.  
  - **CLIP**: Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining for linking text and images.  
- **Libraries**: Deep learning utilities and stable diffusion libraries.  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.8+  
- PyTorch 1.10+  
- BLIP, ViT, and CLIP model weights (Download instructions provided below)  
- Other dependencies:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```  

## Setup  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/username/reverse-engineered-stable-diffusion.git  
   cd reverse-engineered-stable-diffusion  
   ```  
2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. **Download Pretrained Models**:

   - ViT: [Link to ViT weights](https://huggingface.co/models).  
   - CLIP: [Link to CLIP weights](https://github.com/openai/CLIP).  

4. **Run the Project**:  
   ```bash  
   python main.py  
   ```

```  

## How It Works  
1. **Input Image Processing**: The image is preprocessed and passed through the **ViT** model to extract features.  
2. **Language-Image Alignment**: **CLIP** links the extracted image features to text embeddings.  
3. **Prompt Generation**: **BLIP** generates text-based prompts from the image features.  
4. **Loss Computation**: The generated prompts are evaluated, and the model adjusts outputs to minimize loss.  

## Results  
The project successfully demonstrates prompt generation from images using a reverse-engineered stable diffusion pipeline. Further refinements and experiments with loss functions can enhance the model's accuracy.  

## Future Work  
- Experiment with alternative diffusion models.  
- Optimize the loss function for improved prompt accuracy.  
- Expand the dataset for better generalization.
